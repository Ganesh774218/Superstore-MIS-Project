# Superstore-MIS-Project

Project Title

Superstore MIS Project


Project Description

⦁	This project delivers a business-focused analysis of the “Superstore” sales dataset using Microsoft Excel and PivotTables.
⦁	Through systematic data cleaning and structured aggregation, I compute and visualize core KPIs—total sales, gross margin, average order value, and contribution by product and region—to surface performance trends and profitability drivers.
⦁	The work highlights regional and category-level profitability, identifies underperforming or loss-making SKUs, and translates findings into prioritized, actionable recommendations for pricing, assortment, and inventory decisions.
⦁	The analysis is designed for clarity and reuse by business stakeholders, featuring reproducible PivotTable workflows and clear dashboards to support data-driven decision-making.



Objectives
Some of the main business questions and objectives addressed in this project:

⦁	How are sales and profit distributed across customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)?

⦁	Which regions or states generate the most revenue or profit?

⦁	Which product categories or sub-categories contribute most to sales or losses?

⦁	What are the loss-making products (negative profit) that need review?

⦁	What is the profit margin percentage by region or category?

⦁	How has sales trended over time, and what is the forecast for future sales?

⦁	What are the top 10 countries/products by sales or profit?

⦁	How many orders are unprofitable?

⦁	Which product categories have the highest return on investment (ROI) or margin?



Tools & Software

⦁	Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts)
⦁	Excel Power Query (for cleaning/transforming data, if used)
⦁	Formulas: RANK, SUM, IF, custom KPI formulas, growth formulas


Project Structure

Raw Data
The first sheet in the Excel workbook contains the raw dataset, as imported or downloaded.

Analysis Sheet(s)
The second sheet contains cleaned data, Pivot Tables, KPI calculations, and charts.

Pivot Tables & KPIs
Create PivotTables to analyze sales, profit, order count, negative profit items, and other metrics.
Use calculated fields (or helper columns) to compute custom KPIs.

Trend Analysis & Forecasting
Group sales by Month-Year in PivotTable.
Create line charts with trendlines to forecast future sales.

Reporting & Insights
Use PivotTable summaries + KPI cards to present business takeaways: e.g. “loss-making products”, “top-performing segments”, “profit margin by region”.


Key Findings & Insights

⦁	Loss-Making Products: A list of products whose total profit is negative — critical to review for possible price revision, vendor negotiation, or being discontinued.

⦁	Profit Margin by Region: Region X has a profit margin of 18%, while Region Y is only at 8%, indicating different operational efficiencies.

⦁	Top Customer Segment: The “Consumer” segment generates the most sales, but the “Corporate” segment delivers higher profit per order.

⦁	Sales Forecast: Based on the trendline in the monthly sales chart, we forecast ~+10% growth in sales over the next 3–6 months.

⦁	Top 10 Products: The top 10 products by sales contribute more than 40% of total revenue, highlighting core SKUs.

⦁	Negative Order Percentage: ~5% of all orders are loss-making, signalling risk in order-level pricing or cost structure.
